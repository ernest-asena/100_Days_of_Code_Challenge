# Instructions
# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

user_name = input("Enter your name:: ")

no_of_chars = len(user_name)

print(no_of_chars)

# OR JUST DO:

print(len(input("What is your name?:: ")))
