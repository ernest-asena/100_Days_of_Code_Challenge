# Instead of using print multiple times, we can do with a single one and use a line break like here:

# print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
# print("The function is declared like this:")
# print("print('what to print')")

# So all the above becomes:

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function\nThe function is declared like this:\nprint('what to print')")

# STRING CONCATENATION

print("Hello" + " " + "Angela.")
print("Hello " + "Angela.")

# IDENTATION
"""
Python expects neat identation, otherwise would cause IdentationError.
Most code editors have code intelligence that help identify these kinds of errors.
