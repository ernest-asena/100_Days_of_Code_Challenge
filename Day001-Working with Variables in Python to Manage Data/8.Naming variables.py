# Here is what Chatgpt says:

"""
In Python, you can name variables using any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores. However, there are some rules and conventions to follow when naming variables:

Variable names cannot start with a number.

Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. It's good practice to use names that reflect the purpose or content of the variable.

Variable names are case sensitive. For example, "myvar" and "myVar" are two different variables.

Avoid using reserved words, such as "if", "else", "while", "for", "and", "or", etc. as variable names.

Use lowercase letters for variable names. This is a convention in Python.

Here are some examples of valid variable names in Python:


age = 25
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
total_score = 95.5

In summary, when naming variables in Python, choose names that are descriptive, meaningful, and follow the rules and conventions of the language.
