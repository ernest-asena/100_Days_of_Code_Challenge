# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times

# R occurs 1 time

# U occurs 2 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time

# O occurs 0 times

# V occurs 0 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53

# Print: "Your score is 53."

# Example Input 1
# name1 = "Kanye West"
# name2 = "Kim Kardashian"
# Example Output 1
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
# Example Input 2
# name1 = "Brad Pitt"
# name2 = "Jennifer Aniston"
# Example Output 2
# Your score is 73.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is your partner's name? \n")

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
couple_name = name1 + name2
t_count = couple_name.count('t')
r_count = couple_name.count('r')
u_count = couple_name.count('u')
e_count = couple_name.count('e')

true_score = t_count + r_count + u_count + e_count

l_count = couple_name.count('l')
o_count = couple_name.count('o')
v_count = couple_name.count('v')
e_count = couple_name.count('e')

love_score = l_count + o_count + v_count + e_count

true_love_score = str(true_score) + str(love_score)
true_love_score = int(true_love_score)
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.

if true_love_score < 10 or true_love_score > 90:
    print(f"Your score is:: {true_love_score}. You go together like coke and mentos.")
elif 40 <= true_love_score <= 50:
    print(f"Your score is:: {true_love_score}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is: {true_love_score}")
