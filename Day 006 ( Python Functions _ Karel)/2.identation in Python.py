# Indentation is a very important concept of Python because without proper indenting the Python code,
# you will end up seeing IndentationError and the code will not get compiled.

# In simple terms indentation refers to adding white space before a statement. But the question arises is it even necessary?
# To understand this consider a situation where you are reading a book and all of a sudden all the page numbers from the
# book went missing. So you donâ€™t know, where to continue reading and you will get confused.
# This situation is similar with Python. Without indentation, Python does not know which statement to execute next or
# which statement belongs to which block. This will lead to IndentationError.

# Python indentation is a way of telling a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block
# of code. A block is a combination of all these statements.
# Block can be regarded as the grouping of statements for a specific purpose. Most of the programming languages like C,
# C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation to highlight the blocks of code.
# Whitespace is used for indentation in Python. All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same
# block of code. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right. You can understand
# it better by looking at the following lines of code.
