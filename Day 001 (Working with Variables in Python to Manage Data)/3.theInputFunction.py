# used to enter some data
# can be used to get user data for example a name or perhaps age
input('What is your name? ')

# this is a comment.
# Comments in python are created with the pound sign
print("Hello " + input('What is your name?'))

# Exercise: write code that prints the size or length of a name input

name = input('Please enter your name: ')
print(F'Your name is of length:', len(name))

# here is a shorter code to do this same task!!
print(len(input('What is your name: ')))
